**Amazon Route 53**
Amazon Route 53 is a DNS web service provided by Amazon.It provides scalable and highly available Domain Name Systems. The number 53 comes from the TCP UDP port 53 which addresses DNS requests.It enables AWS users to route to different AWS instances, as well as non AWS resources.It provides developers an easy way to route end users to Internet Applications in a reliable and inexpensive way. It translates human readable URLs to numeric IP addresses. One other benefit of Amazon Route 53 is its low latency in answering DNS queries, because of its global network of DNS servers.It also allows users to create and manage their own public DNS Records.
